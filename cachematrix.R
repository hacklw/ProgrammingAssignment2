## This is my solution of the  second programming assignment (week 3) 
## of the Coursera Course "R Programming"
## The assignment was: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
